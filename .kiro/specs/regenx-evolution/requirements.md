# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Re-GenX is a community-driven creature evolution simulator built on Reddit's Devvit platform where groups of 25 players collectively nurture and evolve a shared creature. Similar to a collaborative Tamagotchi, the system presents a pulsating blob creature in a dramatic spotlight setting with 5ft visibility radius, allowing 360Â° viewing. Players guide evolution through democratic voting on mutations while the creature naturally evolves based on the group's collective behavior patterns across Reddit. The experience combines controlled mutations (triggered by group-funded genetic shots with voting on traits) and uncontrolled mutations (random changes influenced by group behavior) to create an engaging, unpredictable evolutionary journey.

## Glossary

- **System**: The Re-GenX application running on Reddit's Devvit platform
- **Creature**: A pulsating blob organism displayed in spotlight with visual mutations and stat attributes that evolves based on group decisions
- **Group**: A fixed collection of 25 Reddit users who share ownership of one Creature
- **Waiting Room**: An abstract queue system where users wait for 25 members to join and form a Group (not a physical virtual space)
- **Evolution Cycle**: A time-bounded period (15 minutes to 2 hours) representing one evolutionary phase
- **Controlled Mutation**: A genetic change triggered by Genetic Shot where the Group votes on specific traits (randomness factor 0.85-0.95)
- **Uncontrolled Mutation**: A random genetic change that occurs automatically, influenced by Group behavior patterns (randomness factor 0.05-0.15)
- **Randomness Factor**: A value between 0 and 1 representing how much control vs randomness applies to a mutation (0 = pure random, 1 = pure control)
- **Genetic Shot**: A purchasable item that triggers a Controlled Mutation, funded by Group member contributions
- **Karma Pool**: Shared virtual currency accumulated by the Group, used to purchase Genetic Shots
- **Mutation Session**: A voting period where Group members select up to 3 traits for a Controlled Mutation
- **Trait**: A specific characteristic of a Mutation (e.g., number of legs, color, size)
- **Spotlight Effect**: The visual presentation showing the Creature illuminated from above with 5ft visibility radius
- **HUD**: Heads-Up Display implemented as a slide-up/down drawer menu showing Creature stats in neon futuristic styling
- **Behavior Pattern**: Aggregate data about which subreddits Group members visit, influencing Uncontrolled Mutations
- **Biome**: An environmental setting (jungle, rocky mountain, etc.) visible within the 5ft radius
- **Mutation Animation**: A 2-3 second visual transition showing the Creature changing
- **Stat Category**: A grouping of related attributes (Mobility, Senses, Survival, Cognition, Vitals)
- **Age**: A stat representing how many Evolution Cycles the Creature has survived
