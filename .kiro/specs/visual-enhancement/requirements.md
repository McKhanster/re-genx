# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the visual enhancement requirements for Re-GenX to achieve a bioluminescent plasma ball aesthetic with glowing neon edges, organic cell-like patterns, and cosmic atmosphere. The goal is to transform the current creature rendering into a visually stunning experience that matches the reference image's style while maintaining performance on mobile devices.

## Glossary

- **Creature Renderer**: The Three.js component responsible for rendering the 3D creature mesh
- **Biome Renderer**: The Three.js component that renders the environment and background
- **Glow Effect**: Visual effect using bloom post-processing to create luminescent edges
- **Cell Pattern**: Organic, irregular polygonal surface patterns resembling biological cells
- **Plasma Effect**: Animated color gradients that flow across the creature surface
- **Starfield**: Particle system representing distant stars in the background
- **Edge Lighting**: Bright neon-colored outlines along geometry edges
- **Post-Processing**: Screen-space effects applied after the main render pass

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the creature to have glowing neon edges with vibrant colors, so that it looks visually striking and otherworldly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Creature Renderer initializes, THE Creature Renderer SHALL apply bloom post-processing with intensity between 1.5 and 2.5
2. WHEN rendering the creature surface, THE Creature Renderer SHALL use emissive materials with color values between 0.3 and 0.8 intensity
3. WHEN displaying edge highlights, THE Creature Renderer SHALL render edges with colors from the cyan-magenta-yellow spectrum
4. WHILE the creature is visible, THE Creature Renderer SHALL maintain edge glow visibility at distances up to 10 units from camera
5. WHERE mobile devices are detected, THE Creature Renderer SHALL reduce bloom samples to maintain 30 frames per second minimum

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the creature surface to display organic cell-like patterns, so that it appears biological and alive

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating creature geometry, THE Creature Renderer SHALL create irregular polygonal cells with 5 to 8 sides each
2. WHEN applying surface patterns, THE Creature Renderer SHALL use Voronoi noise or similar algorithm to create organic cell boundaries
3. WHILE rendering cell patterns, THE Creature Renderer SHALL apply depth variation between 0.1 and 0.3 units to create surface relief
4. WHEN cells are displayed, THE Creature Renderer SHALL render cell boundaries with luminescent edges at 0.5 to 1.0 intensity
5. WHERE mutations occur, THE Creature Renderer SHALL blend new cell patterns smoothly over 2 to 3 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want animated plasma-like colors flowing across the creature, so that it feels dynamic and alive

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the creature is rendered, THE Creature Renderer SHALL apply gradient colors transitioning between cyan, magenta, purple, and teal
2. WHILE the game is running, THE Creature Renderer SHALL animate color flow at 0.2 to 0.5 cycles per second
3. WHEN calculating plasma colors, THE Creature Renderer SHALL use time-based sine wave functions with at least 2 frequency layers
4. WHILE colors animate, THE Creature Renderer SHALL maintain color saturation between 0.7 and 1.0
5. WHERE performance drops below 30 frames per second, THE Creature Renderer SHALL reduce plasma animation complexity by 50 percent



### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the background to have a gradient from dark blue to purple-red, so that it creates atmospheric depth

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Biome Renderer initializes, THE Biome Renderer SHALL create a background gradient from dark blue (RGB 10, 15, 30) to dark purple-red (RGB 60, 20, 40)
2. WHEN rendering the background, THE Biome Renderer SHALL apply the gradient vertically from top to bottom
3. WHILE the camera rotates, THE Biome Renderer SHALL maintain gradient orientation relative to world space
4. WHEN the scene is visible, THE Biome Renderer SHALL ensure background gradient remains behind all other geometry
5. WHERE lighting is calculated, THE Biome Renderer SHALL use gradient colors to tint ambient lighting with 0.2 to 0.4 intensity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the creature to have an inner glow that makes it appear translucent, so that it looks like a plasma ball

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering the creature material, THE Creature Renderer SHALL set material opacity between 0.7 and 0.9
2. WHEN applying inner glow, THE Creature Renderer SHALL use subsurface scattering approximation with 0.3 to 0.6 intensity
3. WHILE the creature is lit, THE Creature Renderer SHALL allow light to penetrate the surface by 0.2 to 0.5 units
4. WHEN viewed from any angle, THE Creature Renderer SHALL maintain visible inner glow with brightness between 0.4 and 0.8
5. WHERE transparency is rendered, THE Creature Renderer SHALL use proper depth sorting to prevent rendering artifacts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want subtle foreground elements that frame the creature, so that the composition feels complete

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Biome Renderer initializes, THE Biome Renderer SHALL create foreground silhouette elements at camera near plane
2. WHEN rendering foreground elements, THE Biome Renderer SHALL use dark colors with cyan-magenta edge highlights
3. WHILE displaying foreground, THE Biome Renderer SHALL position elements at bottom 20 percent of viewport
4. WHEN the camera rotates, THE Biome Renderer SHALL apply parallax effect to foreground at 0.3 to 0.5 multiplier
5. WHERE foreground overlaps creature, THE Biome Renderer SHALL render foreground with 0.3 to 0.5 opacity to maintain creature visibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the visual enhancements to maintain performance on mobile, so that the game remains playable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mobile device is detected, THE Creature Renderer SHALL reduce geometry complexity to 50 percent of desktop version
2. WHEN frame rate drops below 30 frames per second, THE Creature Renderer SHALL automatically reduce post-processing quality
3. WHILE monitoring performance, THE Creature Renderer SHALL measure frame time every 60 frames
4. WHERE performance is degraded, THE Creature Renderer SHALL disable effects in priority order: foreground parallax, plasma animation, bloom intensity
5. WHEN performance recovers above 35 frames per second for 5 seconds, THE Creature Renderer SHALL re-enable one disabled effect
