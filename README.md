# Re-GenX: Personal Creature Companion

A personal creature care game built on Reddit's Devvit platform where you nurture your own unique familiar through feeding, playing, and giving attention. Watch your lustrous platinum-surfaced creature respond to your care with unique animations and visual state changes in a dramatic 3D spotlight environment.

## What is Re-GenX?

Re-GenX is a personal creature companion game where you care for your own unique familiar‚Äîa living, pulsating platinum blob creature displayed in a dramatic spotlight setting. Like a digital Tamagotchi, you must actively feed, play with, and give attention to your familiar to keep it healthy and happy, or risk having it taken away due to neglect.

Your familiar exists in a dynamic biome environment (jungle, rocky mountain, desert, ocean, or cave) on a circular platform, surrounded by complete darkness beyond a 10-meter visibility radius. You can rotate the camera 360¬∞ around your familiar to view it from all angles at eye level (4 feet above ground), creating an intimate, theatrical viewing experience.

The game features a fully functional care system with three interactive actions (Feed, Play, Attention), each with distinct rewards, 5-minute cooldown timers, and unique animations. Your familiar's appearance dynamically changes based on its care level, transitioning between happy, neutral, and sad states with corresponding visual feedback. Stat changes are displayed as floating numbers that appear on screen when your familiar evolves or receives care.
