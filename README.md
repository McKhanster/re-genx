# Re-GenX: Collaborative Creature Evolution

A community-driven creature evolution simulator built on Reddit's Devvit platform where groups of 25 players collectively nurture and evolve a shared creature through democratic voting and behavior-influenced mutations.

## What is Re-GenX?

Re-GenX is an immersive 3D creature visualization experience built on Reddit's Devvit platform. The game presents a mysterious, pulsating blob creature in a dramatic spotlight setting, surrounded by complete darkness. The creature exists in a void-like environment on a circular platform, creating an intimate and focused viewing experience where you observe it from eye level.

The current demo showcases the core 3D rendering foundation with:

- **Living Creature**: An organic, irregularly-shaped blob that continuously pulses and wobbles with lifelike movement
- **Dramatic Lighting**: A powerful spotlight from directly above illuminates the creature in a 60Â° cone
- **Atmospheric Darkness**: Fog creates complete darkness beyond 10 units from the creature
- **Interactive Camera**: Full 360Â° rotation around the creature at eye level with a view that includes the ground plane
- **Adaptive Performance**: Automatically adjusts quality based on device (mobile vs desktop)

This is the foundation for a future collaborative evolution game where groups of 25 players will collectively nurture and evolve shared creatures through democratic voting and behavior-influenced mutations.

## What Makes Re-GenX Unique?

### 1. **Eye-Level Perspective with Ground View**

Re-GenX positions the camera at eye level (1.2 units/4 feet) orbiting 8 units from the creature, but with a viewing angle that looks slightly downward. This creates an intimate perspective where you observe the creature face-to-face while also seeing the circular platform it rests on, giving a sense of spatial grounding in the void.

### 2. **Organic Creature Design**

The creature isn't a perfect sphereâ€”it's an irregularly deformed blob with a unique surface created through mathematical noise functions. Combined with multi-axis wobbling (8% pulsation with 3-4% wobble on each axis), the creature feels genuinely alive and organic, not mechanical.

### 3. **Theatrical Lighting**

A single powerful spotlight from directly above (60Â° cone angle, 2.5 intensity) creates dramatic shadows and highlights, while subtle ambient lighting prevents complete darkness. This theatrical presentation focuses attention entirely on the creature while reducing rendering complexity.

### 4. **Atmospheric Fog System**

Linear fog creates a natural darkness gradient that starts at 10 units and becomes complete by 20 units, making the creature feel like it exists in an infinite void. This is more visually interesting than a simple black background.

### 5. **Adaptive Performance Architecture**

The game automatically detects mobile devices and adjusts:

- **Geometry**: 16 segments on mobile vs 32 on desktop
- **Shadows**: Disabled on mobile, enabled on desktop
- **Antialiasing**: Disabled on mobile for performance
- **Pixel Ratio**: Capped at 1.5x on mobile
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps target on mobile, 60fps on desktop

This ensures smooth performance across all devices without manual settings.

## Current Demo Features

The current implementation showcases the core 3D rendering foundation:

- **Living Blob Creature**: Irregularly-shaped 1.5-unit radius sphere with mathematical noise deformation
- **Organic Animation**: Multi-axis pulsation (8% scale variation) with independent wobble on X, Y, Z axes (3-4% each)
- **Dramatic Spotlight**: 2.5 intensity spotlight from 12 units above with 60Â° cone angle and soft penumbra (0.4)
- **Atmospheric Fog**: Linear fog starting at 10 units, complete darkness by 20 units
- **Eye-Level Camera with Ground View**: Positioned at height 1.2 (4 feet) orbiting at 8-unit radius, looking slightly downward to see both creature and platform
- **360Â° Rotation**: Smooth pointer-based controls (mouse drag on desktop, touch swipe on mobile)
- **Circular Ground Plane**: 15-unit radius dark platform positioned 0.3 units below creature with grid overlay
- **Adaptive Quality System**:
  - **Desktop**: 60fps, 32-segment geometry, shadows, antialiasing, full pixel ratio
  - **Mobile**: 30fps, 16-segment geometry, no shadows, no antialiasing, 1.5x max pixel ratio
- **FPS Throttling**: Precise frame timing to maintain target frame rates
- **Emissive Materials**: Creature glows with 0.5 emissive intensity in cyan-green (0x00ff88)
