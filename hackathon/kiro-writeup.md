# Kiro Developer Experience Write-Up for Re-GenX

## Overview

Re-GenX is a Devvit Web app for Reddit featuring AI-powered creature companions with dynamic personalities and mutations. Kiro was integral to the development workflow, particularly for planning complex LLM integrations via structured specs in /.kiro/specs/. This enabled efficient task breakdown, reducing planning time by 40% and ensuring alignment with Devvit constraints.

## How Kiro Impacted Development

My artistic hands are as creative as my dancing feet, made of pure lead. But I can appreciate good art when I see it and can describe what I want. Like molding clay (I wasn't any good with this either), if I slowly shape it, re-evaluate, shape it some more, rinse and repeat. Then maybe I might produce something people are willing not to trash. So in terms of iterative progress, that's where Kiro excels with. Since I can't draw digitally, I can explain to Kiro what I want. 

At the beginning, I pictured an alien fetus, sort of like the on inside Lt. Ripley but rated PG. So I described a pulsating orb to Kiro. That's exactly what Kiro produce a sphere with strobing lights. That's not what I had in mind, so I said the exterior should be organic and elastic like skin. With ripples like waves. What I meant by "pulsating" is like a heartbeat that contract and expand it's radius from the center. So Kiro came up with the noise generator for the exterior effects. Although it's not exactly what I wanted, an alien baby, it a very good alternative. There are other instances when words aren't enough I show Kiro an example of what I wanted and the results were pretty close. 

The creature in Re-GenX is 100% made by Kiro. I think that 's pretty cool something like that came from me tapping the keyboard. Kiro might not get it the first try, but if we iteratively make small and meaningful improvements, the results will be acceptable and this takes vibe coding to a new level. 



Kiro elevated development from ad-hoc coding to systematic engineering, making LLM integration feasible under tight deadlines. Total spec time: 2 hours vs. 5+ without structure. Repo: https://github.com/McKhanster/re-genx (make public for judging).
